# Outlook-Tools-Addin
So far this outlook addin can:
- list all outlook folder objects in a treeview
- search for items in the selected folder node of the treeview and display them in a list
- sort string and datetime columns of the list by clicking on column header
- select the selected folder node in the outlook explorer
- select the selected email-item in the outlook explorer and show it in the outlook preview
- open the selected email item by doubleclicking on a row of the listview

This addin could be customized to perform further actions on the selected folders/email items. I am open to suggestions what it should be able to do in the future.
